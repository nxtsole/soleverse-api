            history: "Michael Jordan broke out the iconic ‘Flu Game’ rendition of the Jordan 12 during the 1997 NBA Finals against the Utah Jazz. Enduring 103-degree fever and flu-like symptoms, Michael Jordan would suit up anyway and go on to score 38 points, rack up seven rebounds, and dish out five assists before eventually leading the Bulls to yet another title later on in the series. The shoe itself is constructed with a mostly black leather upper with Varsity Red accents on the heel tabs, midsole, and toe to resemble the Chicago team colors.",
